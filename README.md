# MongoDB $inc operator error with string value
This repository demonstrates an incorrect usage of the $inc operator in MongoDB update operations and its solution.  The issue arises from providing a string value to the $inc operator which expects a numeric value.
The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, and `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.
